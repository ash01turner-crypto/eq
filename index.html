        <h1>Project Polaris</h1>
        <p class="tagline">You’re leading a high-stakes project. Your choices shape delivery, trust and burnout.</p>

        <p>You’re the project lead for <strong>Project Polaris</strong> – a critical upgrade that must go live before the end of the quarter.</p>
        <p>Your team is a mix of veterans and newer staff, and senior leaders have made it very clear: this one can’t slip.</p>
        <p>It’s Monday morning. You’ve just grabbed your coffee and opened your inbox. Three things jump out at you:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>A message from your sponsor asking for a “quick status update” by lunchtime.</li>
          <li>A calendar clash between your project stand-up and a key stakeholder workshop.</li>
          <li>A note from HR flagging that one of your team members, Wes, has had several recent absences.</li>

      <!-- TEAM STANDUP -->
      <section class="passage" id="team-standup">
        <h2>Team Stand-up</h2>
        <p>You gather the team in a small meeting room. People look tired. A couple of them check their phones as they sit down.</p>
        <p>“How’s everyone going?” you ask.</p>
        <p>Silence. Then Tash, your senior analyst, speaks up.</p>
        <p><em>“We’re making progress, but the requirements keep changing. And the testing window is shrinking. If we keep adding scope, we’re going to miss the date.”</em></p>
        <p>Some team members nod. Others look away.</p>
        <p>How do you respond?</p>

        <div class="choices">

      <!-- SPONSOR CALL -->
      <section class="passage" id="sponsor-call">
        <h2>Sponsor Call</h2>
        <p>You jump on a quick call with your sponsor, Karen.</p>
        <p><em>“Just checking in,”</em> she says. <em>“The executives want reassurance we’re still on track. I’d like to tell them we’re green.”</em></p>
        <p>You know there are risks: shrinking testing time, some unclear requirements, and a tired team. On paper, the date is still just about achievable.</p>
        <p>What do you say?</p>

        <div class="choices">
          <button class="choice-btn" onclick="goTo('honest-status')">

      <!-- HR CONCERN -->
      <section class="passage" id="hr-concern">
        <h2>HR Concern: Wes</h2>
        <p>You open the HR note about Wes. Several recent sick days cluster around long weekends and key project activities.</p>
        <p>HR has asked you to “check in and provide support” and to note any impact on delivery.</p>
        <p>You find Wes in a quiet corner after the stand-up.</p>
        <p>He looks tired and a little defensive. <em>“Is this about my sick leave?”</em> he asks.</p>
        <p>How do you start the conversation?</p>

        <div class="choices">
          <button class="choice-btn" onclick="goTo('supportive-chat')">

      <!-- PSYCH SAFETY -->
      <section class="passage" id="psych-safety">
        <h2>Creating Psychological Safety</h2>
        <p>You take a breath.</p>
        <p>“I appreciate the honesty,” you say. “If we’re going to hit this date without burning everyone out, I need to know about risks early. Let’s list what’s worrying us most, then we’ll decide together what to escalate or re-plan.”</p>
        <p>You grab a whiteboard and invite input. Slowly, people start contributing. Tash outlines the impact of scope changes. Sam flags a dependency with another team that’s slipping.</p>
        <p>By the end of the meeting you have a clearer picture and a short list of actions.</p>
        <p>What’s your next move?</p>

        <div class="choices">
          <button class="choice-btn" onclick="goTo('honest-status')">

      <!-- DEADLINE PUSH -->
      <section class="passage" id="deadline-push">
        <h2>Pushing the Deadline</h2>
        <p>You smile tightly.</p>
        <p>“I hear you,” you say, “but we committed to this date. Let’s stay positive and just push through. We’ll fine-tune the details as we go.”</p>
        <p>The room goes quiet. A couple of people exchange glances. No one raises any further risks.</p>
        <p>On the surface, things seem under control. Underneath, people start making quiet compromises and assumptions.</p>
        <p>Where do you go next?</p>

        <div class="choices">
          <button class="choice-btn" onclick="goTo('call-for-overtime')">

      <section class="passage" id="scope-detail">
        <h2>Digging into Scope</h2>
        <p>You lean forward.</p>
        <p>“Okay, let’s get specific. What exactly changed, and who requested it?”</p>
        <p>The next 30 minutes are spent mapping recent change requests. You discover that several “small tweaks” from different stakeholders add up to a lot of extra work.</p>
        <p>You realise you need to decide how to handle this.</p>

        <div class="choices">
          <button class="choice-btn" onclick="goTo('manage-scope')">
            Push back on further scope changes and protect the team.

        <h2>Honest Status</h2>
        <p>You decide to be transparent.</p>
        <p>“Karen, we can still aim for the target date,” you say, “but we’re carrying some real risks: expanding scope, limited testing time, and a stretched team. I recommend we report amber with a clear plan: either we lock scope now, add resources, or accept that quality could be impacted.”</p>
        <p>There’s a pause.</p>
        <p><em>“I appreciate the honesty,”</em> she says. <em>“Send me a short summary of those options. I’ll socialise it with the execs. In the meantime, do what you can to stabilise scope.”</em></p>
        <p>You’ve traded short-term comfort for long-term credibility.</p>

        <p>“We’re green,” you say. “There are always a few bumps, but the team is committed. We’ll do what it takes.”</p>
        <p>Karen sounds relieved.</p>
        <p><em>“Great. I’ll tell the execs we’re on track. Keep up the good work.”</em></p>
        <p>You end the call with a knot in your stomach. The risks are still there. Now they’re invisible to everyone except you and the team.</p>

        <p>You steer the conversation.</p>
        <p>“Before we talk status colours, we need to stabilise scope,” you say. “We’re getting changes from multiple directions. If we can agree what’s truly in for this release, we can protect the date and the team.”</p>
        <p>Karen sighs.</p>
        <p><em>“Fair point. Draft a simple ‘in / out’ list and I’ll back you up with the other leaders.”</em></p>

        <p>Wes exhales slowly.</p>
        <p><em>“It’s been rough at home. I’ve been trying to juggle things, but I know I’ve let the team down.”</em></p>
        <p>Together, you explore options: flexible hours, clearer expectations, and which meetings are truly critical.</p>

        <p><em>“I was sick,”</em> he says. <em>“I’m doing my best.”</em></p>
